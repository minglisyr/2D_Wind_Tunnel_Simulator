# Web based 2D Wind Tunnel Simulator
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: The Web-based 2D Wind Tunnel Simulator is an interactive educational tool designed to simulate airflow around a simplified car (half circle) in a two-dimensional environment. This project aims to provide students, engineers, and aerodynamics enthusiasts with a user-friendly platform to visualize and understand fluid dynamics principles without the need for complex physical setups or expensive software.

Key features of the simulator include:
1. Visualization of airflow patterns
2. Adjustable wind speed and car size
3. Interactive flow field display

TODO List:
1. Create basic file structure (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
2. Design main layout
3. Create responsive grid for simulation area
4. Core Simulation Logic
5. Implement color-coded velocity and pressure mapping
6. Implement streamline visualization option
7. Implement smoke visualization option
8. User Controls (Restart, Pause/Resume, Step Forward)
9. User interactive with obstacle positioning and movement
10. Implement wind speed control and car size control
11. Implement Hi/Low resolution switch
12. Performance Optimization
13. Unit Test
14. Publish project to GitHub Pages or similar hosting service
15. Create project showcase video and update README with link

Future Development:
1. Complicated Car-shape obstacle (obstacle detector with arbitary shapes)
2. User-defined obstacle
